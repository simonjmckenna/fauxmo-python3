# fauxmo-python3

A Python 3 variant of @makermusings fauxmo python code to allow
an Amazon Echo to drive pseudo WeMo devices hosted on the Reapberry Pi

The initial goal is to control three device types

1) LG Smart Tv - my py-lg-tv-control repo
2) Marantz AV reciever - my py-marantz-amp-control repo
3) Energenie 433Mhz plugs.

I've got the fauxmo.py and developemnt.py files (development.py is based on the example_minimal.py)
